	<string id="dolg_outfit_name">
		<text>PS5-M Universal Protection</text>
	</string>

	<string id="dolg_outfit_description">
		<text>This modern version of the Duty bodysuit is better suited for stalker recruits who are used to lightweight suits. Unlike the PSZ series, this suit provides good protection against anomalies while also being capable of stopping a pistol bullet. The suit cannot be modified with an artefact container, but may be upgraded with a combat support system instead.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="dolg_heavy_outfit_name">
		<text>PSZ-9d body armour</text>
	</string>

	<string id="dolg_heavy_outfit_description">
		<text>This early model of the Duty bodysuit is the Spetsnaz PSZ-9 body armour modified for the Zone. The suit is capable of stopping a rifle bullet, however, this level of protection comes at the cost of its weight, bulkiness and virtually non-existent anomaly protection. The suit cannot be modified with an artefact container, but may be upgraded with a combat support system.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="dolg_exo_outfit_name">
		<text>Duty exoskeleton</text>
	</string>

	<string id="dolg_exo_outfit_description">
		<text>The Duty members decided using heavier materials to improve bullet resistance over others, this version of the exoskeleton though heavy makes one feel like a tank. The only downfall is the weak anomaly protection provided with the armour is very lacking and even the most basic of anomalies can take down this tank. Does not come with an artefact container.</text>
	</string>

		<text>Duty scientific suit</text>

		<text>Sentinel of Freedom</text>
	</string>

	<string id="svoboda_heavy_outfit_description">
		<text>This stalker bodysuit with reinforced body armour made by Freedom craftsmen represents a good compromise between combat and anomaly protection. The built-in body armour comprises armour plating and ten Kevlar layers, capable of stopping a pistol bullet. The suit uses the relatively expensive Sovereign compound for anomaly protection. Comes with an artefact container.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="svoboda_light_outfit_name">
		<text>Winds of Freedom</text>
	</string>

	<string id="svoboda_light_outfit_description">
		<text>This lightweight stalker bodysuit is made by Freedom craftsmen. The suit's fabric is treated with Horizon, a special solution developed by the faction by trial and error to increase resistance to anomalies. Like the Sunrise suit, the Wind of Freedom comes with built-in body armour and artefact container.</text>

  	<string id="svoboda_heavy_outfit_2_name">
    		<text>Guardian of Freedom</text>
  	</string>

  	<string id="svoboda_heavy_outfit_2_description">
    		<text>A modern Freedom model. It is more suitable to new stalker recruits, who are used to simpler suits. Unlike the PS3 series, this variation provides decent protection from anomalies and minimal protection from bullets. Comes with built-in artefact container.</text>

  	<string id="svoboda_exo_outfit_name">
    		<text>Freedom exoskeleton</text>
  	</string>

  	<string id="svoboda_exo_outfit_description">
    		<text>An upgraded version of a regular exoskeleton. The use of lighter materials allowed the designers to reduce the suit's weight and with Freedom's usual trademark of high quality anomaly protection the only thing that suffers is its overall armour and impact. Comes with built-in artefact container.</text>
  	</string>

	<string id="svoboda_scientific_outfit_name">
		<text>Freedom scientific suit</text>
	</string>

	<string id="svoboda_scientific_outfit_description">
		<text>Produced with the participation of partisans from the group "Freedom" for especially for research in the Zone. The closed system of breathing and special treatment materials provide excellent protection against harmful radiation and anomalous effects. However, a built-in body armour breaks even pistol bullets, so the suit is not suitable for active hostilities. Fully upgradeable and boasting built-in artefact container.</text>

<!--			-- Loner --				-->



	<string id="novice_outfit_name">
		<text>Beige leather jacket</text>
	</string>

	<string id="novice_outfit_description">
		<text>The leather jacket does not provide sufficient protection from the Zone's harsh conditions, since it's simply a leather anorak with blue trousers tucked into hiking boots. Typically, it's also worn with a backpack with extra straps across the chest. Leather offers little protection from gunfire or claws and it's absolutely useless against radiation or anomalies.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="stalker_outfit_name">
		<text>Sunrise bodysuit</text>
	</string>

	<string id="stalker_outfit_description">
		<text>This DIY stalker bodysuit is a combination of a bodysuit of twin-layered rubberized cloth with plexiglass lining and built-in body armour. Despite the fact that the body armour is incapable of protecting the wearer from even pistol bullets, the suit enjoys great popularity due to its low cost and modification potential. Comes with built-in artefact container.</text>

		<text>Exoskeleton</text>
	</string>

	<string id="exo_outfit_description">
		<text>An experimental sample of a military exoskeleton. Was never mass-produced due to extraordinary cost and some design flaws. Despite this, it is in demand due to its ability to take on the weight of all carried equipment, and therefore small batches are made in underground facilities outside Ukraine. Comes with a built-in artefact container.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="scientific_outfit_name">
		<text>SEVA bodysuit</text>
	</string>

	<string id="scientific_outfit_description">
		<text>This suit, produced by one of Kiev's Defence Research Institutes, is a great alternative to home-made stalker suits. While its built-in body armour can only stop a pistol round, the anomaly and radiation protection system is second to none. Fully upgradeable and boasting built-in artefact container, this bodysuit is the equipment of choice for many experienced stalkers.</text>

	<string id="trenchcoat_outfit_description">
		<text>A regular black leather trench coat. Has no special purpose other than to keep the wearer warm at night or protect him from a blind dog bite. Although the trench coat is not particularly comfortable, it is often used by bandits in the Zone - either because it allows them to hide in the dark or simply due to its "cool" appearance.</text>

		<text>Bandit mercenary suit</text>
	</string>

	<string id="banditmerc_outfit_description">

		<text>An aluminium/titanium helmet with a cloth exterior that comes with pockets for additional steel armour pieces and an armour face mask. Sphere M12 is normally used as part of a combination that includes PSZ series Spetsnaz body armour. Quite popular in the Zone thanks to its respirator and built-in first generation night vision device, as well as providing the maximum head protection possible. Comes with electronics slots.</text>

		<text>Steel helmet</text>
	</string>

	<string id="st_helm_hardhat_descr">

		<text>Screen helmet</text>
	</string>

	<string id="st_helm_protective_descr">
		<text>A light helmet with an airtight visor intended for protection from anomalies. Judging by the design, the helmet is made by the same Defence Research Institutes as the SEVA bodysuit. Its intended use may very well be in combination with military suits for operations in highly anomalous areas. </text>

		<text>M40 Field Protective Mask</text>
	</string>

	<string id="st_helm_m40_descr">
		<text>The M40 was the result of a program in the 1980s to develop a successor to the M17-series protective masks. The M40 was to be a return to conventional gas mask design with an external side-mounted filter canister, rather than the internal cheek filters of the M17, which were awkward to change, especially in a contaminated environment. The M40 is favoured amongst westerners such as the Mercenaries, lacking strong protection vs. anomalies the M40 provide moderate bullet protection.</text>
